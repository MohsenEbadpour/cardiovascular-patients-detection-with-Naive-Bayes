# cardiovascular patients detection with Naive Bayes
The source code is a simple implementation for cardiovascular patients detection from scratch with the python programming language and Naive Bayes. In source (1), it is assumed that all discrete variables are independent and all continuous variables are in a multivariate normal distribution. Also, in source (2), it is assumed that all variables are independent, and it is analyzed the effect of removing two features.

### Note
This code was written as my Machine Learning course's assignment in the fall of 2021, so it may have some bugs to fix or be coded more optimally.
