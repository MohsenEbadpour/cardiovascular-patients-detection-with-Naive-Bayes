# cardiovascular patients detection with Naive Bayes
The source code is a simple implementation for cardiovascular patients detection from scratch with the python programming language and Naive Bayes. 

### Note
This code was written as my Machine Learning course's assignment in the fall of 2021, so it may have some bugs to fix or be coded more optimally.
